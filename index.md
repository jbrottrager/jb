Hi, I'm Judith Brottrager and I'm a PhD researcher at the TU Darmstadt. I hold bachelor's degrees in Comparative Literature and English and American Studies (University of Vienna) and a master's degree in Linguistic and Literary Computing (TU Darmstadt). As a proud member of the DFG Priority Programme  <a href="https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/" ­target="_blank"­>Computational Literary Studies</a>, I'm currently working on my PhD thesis on issues of canonisation in English and German literary history.<br><br>
